# Restaurant Locator

This project is a restaurant showcase built with **Next.js** and **React**. It lets visitors select their preferred location, automatically suggesting the closest branch via browser geolocation. The UI uses **Tailwind CSS** and Radix UI components to provide a polished experience, including detailed menus, image galleries and modals.
